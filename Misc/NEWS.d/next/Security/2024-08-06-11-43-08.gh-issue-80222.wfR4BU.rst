Fix bug in the folding of quoted strings when flattening an email message using
a modern email policy. Previously when a quoted string was folded so that
it spanned more than one line, the surrounding quotes and internal escapes
would be omitted. This could theoretically be used to spoof header lines
using a carefully constructed quoted string if the resulting rendered email
was transmitted or re-parsed.
