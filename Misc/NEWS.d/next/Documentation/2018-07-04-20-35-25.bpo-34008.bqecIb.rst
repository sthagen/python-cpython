The :c:func:`Py_Main` documentation moved from the "Very High Level API" section to the
"Initialization and Finalization" section.

Also make it explicit that we expect ``Py_Main`` to typically be called instead
of ``Py_Initialize`` rather than after it (since ``Py_Main`` makes its own
call to ``Py_Initialize``). Document that calling both is
supported but is version dependent on which settings
will be applied correctly.
