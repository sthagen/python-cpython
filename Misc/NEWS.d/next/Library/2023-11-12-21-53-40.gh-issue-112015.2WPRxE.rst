:func:`ctypes.memoryview_at` now exists to create a
:class:`memoryview` object that refers to the supplied pointer and
length. This works like :func:`ctypes.string_at` except it avoids a
buffer copy, and is typically useful when implementing pure Python
callback functions that are passed dynamically-sized buffers.
