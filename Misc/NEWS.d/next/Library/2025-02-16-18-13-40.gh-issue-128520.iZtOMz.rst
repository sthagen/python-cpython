Apply type conversion consistently in :class:`pathlib.PurePath` and
:class:`~pathlib.Path` methods can accept a path object as an argument, such
as :meth:`~pathlib.PurePath.match` and :meth:`~pathlib.Path.rename`. The
argument is now converted to path object if it lacks a
:meth:`~pathlib.PurePath.with_segments` attribute, and not otherwise.
