Fix :func:`os.link` on platforms (like Linux) where the
system :c:func:`!link` function does not follow symlinks. On Linux,
it now follows symlinks by default or if
``follow_symlinks=True`` is specified. On Windows, it now raises an error if
``follow_symlinks=True`` is passed. On macOS, it now raises an error if
``follow_symlinks=False`` is passed and the system :c:func:`!linkat`
function is not available at runtime.
