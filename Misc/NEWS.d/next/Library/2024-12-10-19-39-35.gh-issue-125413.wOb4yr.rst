Add :attr:`pathlib.Path.info` attribute, which stores an object
implementing the :class:`pathlib.types.PathInfo` protocol (also new). The
object supports querying the file type and internally caching
:func:`~os.stat` results. Path objects generated by
:meth:`~pathlib.Path.iterdir` are initialized with file type information
gleaned from scanning the parent directory.
