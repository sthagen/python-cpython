The default :mod:`multiprocessing` start method on Linux and other POSIX
systems has been changed away from often unsafe ``"fork"`` to ``"forkserver"``
(when the platform supports sending file handles over pipes as most do) or
``"spawn"``.  Mac and Windows are unchanged as they already default to
``"spawn"``.
