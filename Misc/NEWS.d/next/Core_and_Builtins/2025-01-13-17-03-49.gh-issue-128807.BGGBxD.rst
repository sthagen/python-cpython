Add a marking phase to the free-threaded GC.  This is similar to what was
done in GH-126491.  Since the free-threaded GC does not have generations and
is not incremental, the marking phase looks for all objects reachable from
known roots.  The roots are objects known to not be garbage, like the module
dictionary for :mod:`sys`.  For most programs, this marking phase should
make the GC a bit faster since typically less work is done per object.
