``from __future__ import barry_as_FLUFL`` now works in more contexts,
including when it is used in files, with the ``-c`` flag, and in the REPL
when there are multiple statements on the same line. Previously, it worked
only on subsequent lines in the REPL, and when the appropriate flags were
passed directly to :func:`compile`. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
