A new type of interpreter has been added to CPython. This interpreter uses tail calls for its instruction handlers. Preliminary benchmark results suggest 7-11% geometric mean faster on pyperformance (depending on platform), and up to 30% faster on Python-intensive workloads. This interpreter currently only works on newer compilers, such as ``clang-19``. Other compilers will continue using the old interpreter. Patch by Ken Jin, with ideas on how to implement this in CPython by Mark Shannon, Garret Gu, Haoran Xu, and Josh Haberman.
