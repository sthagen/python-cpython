The free-threaded version of the cyclic garbage collector has been optimized to
conditionally use CPU prefetch instructions during the collection.  This can
reduce collection times by making it more likely that data is in the CPU cache
when it is needed.  The prefetch instructions are enabled if the number of
long-lived objects (objects surviving a full collection) exceeds a threshold.
