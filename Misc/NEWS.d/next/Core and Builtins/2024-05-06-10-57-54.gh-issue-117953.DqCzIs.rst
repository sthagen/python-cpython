When a builtin or extension module is imported for the first time, while a
subinterpreter is active, the module's init function is now run by the main
interpreter first before import continues in the subinterpreter.
Consequently, single-phase init modules now fail in an isolated
subinterpreter without the init function running under that interpreter,
whereas before it would run under the subinterpreter *before* failing,
potentially leaving behind global state and callbacks and otherwise leaving
the module in an inconsistent state.
