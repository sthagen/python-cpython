Don't use designated initializer syntax in inline functions in internal
headers. They cause problems for C++ or MSVC users who aren't yet using the
latest C++ standard (C++20). While internal, pycore_backoff.h, is included
(indirectly, via pycore_code.h) by some key 3rd party software that does so
for speed.
