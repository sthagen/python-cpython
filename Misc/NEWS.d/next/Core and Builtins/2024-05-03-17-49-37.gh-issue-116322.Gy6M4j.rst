In ``--disable-gil`` builds, the GIL will be enabled while loading C extension modules. If the module indicates that it supports running without the GIL, the GIL will be disabled once loading is complete. Otherwise, the GIL will remain enabled for the remainder of the interpreter's lifetime. This behavior does not apply if the GIL has been explicitly enabled or disabled with ``PYTHON_GIL`` or ``-Xgil``.
